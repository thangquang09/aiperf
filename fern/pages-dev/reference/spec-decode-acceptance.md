# Per-Request Speculative-Decoding Acceptance

When an inference server runs speculative decoding, it can report how well the
draft model did on each request: how many draft tokens it proposed, how many
were accepted, and the distribution of accepted-draft counts per verify step.
AIPerf captures this as an **engine-neutral per-request record** so the metrics
layer can reason about acceptance without knowing which engine produced it.

This page documents the record, the adapter interface that fills it, and the
vLLM adapter (the first supported engine). SGLang and TensorRT-LLM adapters are
future work and reuse the same record.

## The engine-neutral record

`SpecDecodeAcceptanceRecord`
([`src/aiperf/common/models/spec_decode_models.py`](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/aiperf/blob/main/src/aiperf/common/models/spec_decode_models.py))
is one record per request, attached to `ParsedResponseRecord.spec_decode_acceptance`.
It is deliberately **tree-agnostic** (a histogram, not per-position arrays) and
**adaptive-safe** (no fixed `k` assumption) so it survives variable-length
drafting such as DSpark-style adaptive verification.

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `engine` | Serving engine that produced the stats (e.g. `vllm`). |
| `mean_acceptance_length` | Mean tokens per verify step including the bonus token: `1 + num_accepted_draft_tokens / num_spec_steps`. Ranges `1.0` … `num_spec_tokens + 1`. |
| `draft_acceptance_rate` | `num_accepted_draft_tokens / num_draft_tokens`. Draft-only. |
| `acceptance_histogram` | Sparse `{accepted_draft_count: num_steps}` map with **integer** keys. Zero-count buckets omitted. Excludes the bonus token. |
| `num_accepted_draft_tokens` | Total accepted draft tokens (excludes bonus). |
| `num_draft_tokens` | Total proposed draft tokens counted toward acceptance (the denominator of `draft_acceptance_rate`). Engines that discard some proposals before counting report the post-adjustment total; see the engine section. |
| `num_spec_steps` | Number of verify steps. Equals the sum of the histogram counts. |
| `num_spec_tokens` | Maximum draft length per step (`k`) when the engine has a fixed per-step bound. `None` (the field is optional) when the engine reports no fixed bound, e.g. fully variable-length drafting. |
| `completion_tokens` | Output tokens for the request, copied from the response `usage` so a consumer holding only this record can normalize acceptance against output length. `None` when the response carried no usage. |
| `per_step_accepted` / `per_step_drafted` | Ordered arrays, one entry per verify step (a temporal axis — not positions in a draft tree). Present only when the engine reports per-step data; `None` otherwise. |

Descriptions here are engine-neutral; how a specific engine populates them (field
names, which level emits the per-step arrays, counting caveats) lives in that
engine's section below.

## The adapter interface

An adapter is the **only** component that knows an engine's on-the-wire
spec-decode shape. It reads the raw payload captured on the parsed responses
(`ParsedResponse.spec_decode_stats`) and returns a `SpecDecodeAcceptanceRecord`,
so nothing engine-specific leaks into the metrics layer.

Adapters are a plugin category (`spec_decode_adapter`) and are resolved by
**auto-detection**, mirroring custom-dataset-loader detection: the parser walks
registered adapters in priority order and uses the first whose `can_adapt`
recognizes the payload by its engine-specific signature — so an adapter claims
only its own payloads and defers on a foreign one. Both methods are classmethods
(adapters are stateless).

```python
@runtime_checkable
class SpecDecodeAdapterProtocol(Protocol):
    @classmethod
    def can_adapt(cls, responses: list[ParsedResponse]) -> bool: ...
    @classmethod
    def adapt(cls, responses: list[ParsedResponse]) -> SpecDecodeAcceptanceRecord | None: ...
```

```

## The vLLM adapter

`VLLMSpecDecodeAdapter` reads vLLM's response-root `metrics.speculative_decoding`
object, emitted when the server runs with `--per-request-spec-decode-metrics`
(`summary` or `detailed`). The field names and shape track vLLM PR
[#48915](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/48915); its *Per-Request
Acceptance Metrics* feature doc is the authoritative wire-format reference. It is
present on chat and completions, streaming and non-streaming; in streaming it
rides the trailing `include_usage` chunk (empty `choices`) at the response root.

Because vLLM emits that trailing chunk only when `stream_options.include_usage`
is set, AIPerf requests it on **every** streaming run -- not just when
`--use-server-token-count` is on, which would otherwise silently drop the
metrics. The chunk carries no content, so it is excluded from timing metrics via
`ParsedResponseRecord.content_responses`, and token counting still follows the
`use_server_token_count` config rather than the presence of `usage`. To opt out,
set the field explicitly: `--extra-inputs '{"stream_options":
{"include_usage": false}}'`.

The wire object maps to the record one-to-one, except:

- **`acceptance_histogram` is a dense `list[int]`** -- index `j` holds the number
  of verify steps that accepted exactly `j` draft tokens (length
  `num_spec_tokens + 1`). AIPerf inflates it into the record's sparse
  `{j: count}` map, dropping zero-count buckets.
- **`completion_tokens`** is copied from the response `usage` (not the payload)
  so the record trace carries it next to acceptance; no metric consumes it yet.
  `None` when the server omits usage.
- **`num_draft_tokens`** is vLLM's post-adjustment count: drafts invalidated by
  structured-output/grammar constraints are already subtracted server-side.
- **`num_spec_tokens`** is always present (the configured `num_speculative_tokens`);
  vLLM's DSpark/DFlash drafters are fixed-block, so `k` stays defined even there.
- The `detailed` level adds `per_step_accepted` / `per_step_drafted`; `summary`
  omits them (they stay `None`).
- `mean_acceptance_length` / `draft_acceptance_rate` are taken verbatim
  (the server already computes them safely, including the zero-step case).

### Missing-field and edge cases

- **Field absent** (spec decode off, or the request had no verify steps): the
  record is `None` and dependent metrics simply do not show. This is the common
  case and is not an error.
- **Zero-step / fully-rejected**: reported verbatim (empty or `{0: N}`
  histogram, `mean_acceptance_length == 1.0`).
- **Malformed payload**: the adapter degrades to `None` rather than raising, so
  one bad response cannot abort a run. Records whose aggregate counts contradict
  each other (histogram not summing to `num_spec_steps`, etc.) are rejected the
  same way.
- **`n > 1`**: vLLM populates `metrics.speculative_decoding` only when the stats
  are attributable to a single generation stream, leaving it `null` otherwise --
  for `n > 1` on both endpoints, and additionally for **multi-prompt** requests
  on completions (`prompt: ["a", "b"]`), where timestamps would span prompts.
  Because the object is at the response root -- not per-choice -- AIPerf simply
  reads it as present or absent; no client-side suppression is needed, and such
  requests yield no record. AIPerf sends one prompt per request, so in practice
  only `n > 1` triggers this.
- **Behind Dynamo** the custom field is currently stripped, so this path is
  direct-to-vLLM only.
