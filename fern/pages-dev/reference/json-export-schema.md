# `profile_export_aiperf.json` Schema

After every `aiperf profile` run, AIPerf writes a summary JSON file (default name `profile_export_aiperf.json`) under the artifact directory. Each top-level metric entry holds a stats block; this page documents which fields appear in that block, when they appear, and how the schema is versioned.

The on-disk shape is produced by `JsonMetricResult` in [`src/aiperf/common/models/export_models.py`](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/aiperf/blob/main/src/aiperf/common/models/export_models.py). Fields that are unset are omitted from the JSON output (`exclude_none=True`), so the field set per metric varies by metric type — this page is the source of truth for which fields to expect where.

## Per-metric stats fields

| Field | Type | Always present? | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `unit` | string | yes | Display unit, e.g. `"ms"`, `"requests/sec"`, `"tokens"`. |
| `avg` | float | record metrics with observations; derived/aggregate metrics | For derived/aggregate scalar metrics, `avg` carries the single computed value. |
| `min` | number | record metrics with a distribution | Smallest observation. |
| `max` | number | record metrics with a distribution | Largest observation. |
| `p1`, `p5`, `p10`, `p25`, `p50`, `p75`, `p90`, `p95`, `p99` | float | record metrics with a distribution | Percentiles. Omitted for derived/aggregate metrics that have no distribution. |
| `std` | float | record metrics with a distribution | Sample standard deviation. |
| `count` | int | **record metrics only** | Number of records contributing to the distribution. Intentionally omitted for derived/aggregate scalar metrics where it would trivially be 1 and risks being misread as the request count. |
| `sum` | number | record metrics with a distribution sum | Sum of all observations. Absent for derived metrics whose value is itself a computed rate or total. |

The metric type (`record` / `aggregate` / `derived`) is documented per-metric in [Metrics Reference](../metrics-reference.md). At a glance: latencies and per-request lengths are `record`; counts and timestamps are `aggregate`; throughputs and run-level totals are `derived`.

### Example

A run with 20 requests against a streaming chat endpoint produces entries shaped like this:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "1.4",
  "request_latency": {
    "unit": "ms",
    "avg": 2620.71,
    "min": 2145.06,
    "max": 3411.10,
    "p50": 2568.73,
    "p99": 3371.24,
    "std": 297.93,
    "count": 20,
    "sum": 52414.29
  },
  "request_throughput": {
    "unit": "requests/sec",
    "avg": 1.45
  },
  "request_count": {
    "unit": "requests",
    "avg": 20.0
  }
}
```

Note that `request_throughput` (derived) and `request_count` (aggregate) carry only `unit` + `avg` — no `count`, no `sum`, no percentiles. `request_latency` (record) carries the full set.

## Top-level fields

In addition to the per-metric stats blocks, `profile_export_aiperf.json` includes top-level provenance:

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `schema_version` | string | This document's schema version. |
| `aiperf_version` | string | AIPerf version that produced this export. |
| `benchmark_id` | string | Per-run unique identifier. |
| `start_time`, `end_time` | datetime | UTC. |
| `was_cancelled` | bool | True if the run was interrupted. |
| `input_config` | object | Resolved `BenchmarkConfig` body (does NOT carry envelope-level `random_seed`, `sweep`, `multi_run`, or `variables`). |
| `run_info` | object | Per-run reproducibility — see below. Schema 1.2+. |
| `telemetry_data` | object | GPU telemetry summaries when telemetry collection was active. |
| `error_summary` | array | Per-error counts collected during the run. |

### `telemetry_data`

Schema 1.4 adds a `platform` field to each GPU summary and vendor-scopes GPU
telemetry metric names. NVIDIA metrics collected through DCGM or pynvml use
`nvidia_*` names, and AMD metrics collected through amdsmi use `amd_*` names.
Metric semantics are platform-specific; cross-platform comparisons require
validation of the workload, collector behavior, and metric definitions.

```json
"telemetry_data": {
  "endpoints": {
    "localhost:9400": {
      "gpus": {
        "gpu_0": {
          "gpu_index": 0,
          "gpu_name": "NVIDIA H100",
          "gpu_uuid": "GPU-...",
          "platform": "nvidia",
          "metrics": {
            "nvidia_power_usage": {"unit": "W", "avg": 310.0},
            "nvidia_gpu_utilization": {"unit": "%", "avg": 85.0}
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### `run_info`

Schema 1.2 introduced `run_info` to surface the seed and sweep coordinates needed to reproduce a run from the JSON file alone, without consulting the internal `run_config.json` handoff file. Schema 1.3 extends it with identifiers and the redacted CLI command.

| Field | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `benchmark_id` | string | Per-run unique identifier (`BenchmarkRun.benchmark_id`). Duplicates the top-level `benchmark_id` so `run_info` is a self-contained reproducibility block. |
| `sweep_id` | string / null | UUID4 of the outer sweep this run belongs to (`BenchmarkPlan.sweep_id`). Stable across every variation and trial of one plan; lets readers join all per-run JSON exports from the same sweep. Null for runs constructed outside the multi-run orchestrator. |
| `random_seed` | int / null | Resolved per-run seed. Null when the user opted out of consistent seeding and `--random-seed` was not set. For grid/zip/scenario sweeps this is `base_seed + variation_index`; for adaptive iterations beyond the plan-time list it is SHA-256 derived from `(envelope_seed, variation.label)`. |
| `trial` | int | Zero-based trial index within this variation. |
| `run_label` | string | Human-readable run label (`run_0001`, `concurrency_10`, etc.). |
| `variation_label` | string | Sweep variation label, or `base` for non-sweep runs. |
| `variation_index` | int | Sweep variation index (0 for non-sweep / first cell). |
| `variation_values` | object | Sweep parameter point as `{path: value}`. Empty for non-sweep runs. |
| `cli_command` | string / null | Redacted command line used to launch the run. Secrets such as API keys are removed before export. Null when the run was constructed without a CLI command. |

Example for variation 2 of a `concurrency` grid sweep with `--random-seed 42`:

```json
"run_info": {
  "benchmark_id": "abc123def456",
  "sweep_id": "8c4f9a2e-1234-4567-89ab-0123456789ab",
  "random_seed": 44,
  "trial": 0,
  "run_label": "run_0001",
  "variation_label": "concurrency_40",
  "variation_index": 2,
  "variation_values": {"phases.profiling.concurrency": 40},
  "cli_command": "aiperf profile --model meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct --url http://localhost:8000 --request-count 500"
}
```

## Schema versions

The current schema version is exported as the top-level `schema_version` field on the JSON document. Bump on additive changes; coordinate a major bump for any field rename or removal.

| Version | Change |
|---|---|
| `1.0` | Initial shape: `unit`, `avg`, `min`, `max`, `std`, `p1`–`p99`. |
| `1.1` | Added `count` and `sum` to per-metric stats blocks. Backward-compatible for readers that ignore unknown fields; the new fields are present only on record-type metrics, omitted on derived/aggregate. |
| `1.2` | Added top-level `run_info` block (`random_seed`, `trial`, `run_label`, `variation_label`, `variation_index`, `variation_values`). Backward-compatible: readers that don't need reproducibility can ignore the field. |
| `1.3` | Added `benchmark_id`, `sweep_id`, and `cli_command` to `run_info`. `benchmark_id` duplicates the top-level field so `run_info` is self-contained; `sweep_id` (UUID4 of the outer sweep) lets readers join all per-run exports from one plan without consulting the parent multi-run artifact directory; `cli_command` records the redacted command line when available. Backward-compatible: nullable fields default to `null` when unavailable. |
| `1.4` | Added optional top-level `warmup_metrics`, keyed by metric tag, containing metrics computed only from warmup-phase requests. Existing top-level metric fields remain profiling-only. |
| `1.5` | Added per-GPU telemetry `platform` and renamed built-in NVIDIA GPU telemetry metrics to `nvidia_*`. AMD telemetry remains under `amd_*`. This is a telemetry metric-name breaking change for consumers of `telemetry_data`. |

### Other JSON exports use independent schema versions

`aiperf` writes additional JSON files when `--num-profile-runs >= 2`:

- `profile_export_aiperf_aggregate.json` — confidence aggregation across runs. Per-metric blocks have a different shape (`mean`, `std`, `cv`, `se`, `ci_low`, `ci_high`, `t_critical`, `unit`) and own their own `schema_version` (`AggregateConfidenceJsonExporter.SCHEMA_VERSION`, currently `"1.0"`).
- `profile_export_aiperf_collated.json` — pools per-request values from all runs into a single population, then emits combined percentiles (`mean`, `std`, `p50`, `p90`, `p95`, `p99`, `count`) under a `combined` key plus a `per_run` list of run-level summaries. Uses its own `schema_version` (`"1.0.0"`).

The `schema_version` documented on this page applies only to `profile_export_aiperf.json`. The other files evolve on their own cadence.

### `outputs.json` schema

`outputs.json` holds the generated response text for each request. It is written when `--export-outputs-json` is set, which `--export-level raw` implies (pass `--no-export-outputs-json` to opt out). With `--profile-export-prefix foo` the file is named `foo_outputs.json`.

It carries its own `schema_version` (`OutputsJsonExporter.SCHEMA_VERSION`, currently `"1.1"`), independent of the one documented on this page.

```json
{
  "schema_version": "1.1",
  "data": [
    {
      "session_num": 0,
      "conversation_id": "964a5c5e-9415-4a69-8c81-6ab51671ff39",
      "turn_index": 0,
      "x_request_id": "ebeeb5d1-2afa-4d58-bacf-2866e69d28e2",
      "benchmark_phase": "profiling",
      "request_start_ns": 1788226305237111762,
      "request_end_ns": 1788226305315824596,
      "metrics": {"input_sequence_length": 20, "output_token_count": 10},
      "response_text": "tys field Thy youths proud livery so gazed"
    }
  ],
  "warmup": []
}
```

- **`data` is profiling-only.** Warmup responses live in the separate top-level `warmup` array, so consumers that aggregate over `data` never count warmup traffic. Both arrays are sorted by `(session_num, turn_index)`.
- **`benchmark_phase`** is `profiling` or `warmup` and matches the array the entry sits in. Only a known-warmup phase is routed to `warmup`; an unrecognized phase stays in `data`.
- **`response_text`** is the concatenated generated text. For models that emit a separate reasoning channel, reasoning and answer are concatenated. It is `null` when the response carried no content.
- **`metrics`** holds an allowlisted subset in display units (`input_sequence_length`, `output_token_count`, `output_sequence_length`, `request_latency`, `time_to_first_token`, `inter_token_latency`). Streaming-only metrics are absent from non-streaming records.
- Schema `1.1` added `warmup` and `benchmark_phase`; both are additive over `1.0`.

### Named phase artifacts

Named multi-phase workflows keep the root exports (`profile_export_aiperf.{json,csv}`, `server_metrics_export.{json,csv}`, and related files) as backward-compatible aggregate artifacts. Phase-scoped artifacts are additive and are referenced from `phase_manifest.json`, for example `phases/<phase_name>/profile_export_aiperf.json`, `phases/<phase_name>/profile_export_aiperf.csv`, and, when server metrics produced data for that phase, `phases/<phase_name>/server_metrics.json`.

For server metrics specifically, the root `server_metrics_export.json` preserves the legacy aggregate semantic phase view; in workflows with multiple phases of the same kind, its phase ranges may span inter-phase gaps. Consumers that need exact per-phase telemetry should read the phase-scoped `server_metrics.json` files.

## For downstream parsers

- **Treat absent fields as "not applicable to this metric type," not "data missing."** A derived-metric block with no `count` is normal; a record-metric block with no `count` indicates a bug.
- **Do not assume the field set is closed.** Future minor schema bumps may add fields. Use `schema_version` to detect compat; ignore unknown fields.
- **`unit` is authoritative for the value's interpretation.** Do not infer units from the metric tag.
