# Memory Estimator

AIPerf ships a static memory estimator that predicts the peak and steady-state
RSS of every pod in a Kubernetes deployment from the benchmark configuration.
It is an **advisory** report: `aiperf kube generate`, `aiperf kube profile`, and
the operator preflight all run it and surface its output, but none of them
rewrite the pod's `resources` block from it. Actual requests/limits come from
the `AIPERF_K8S_*` resource settings in `src/aiperf/kubernetes/environment.py`.

If your `records-manager` OOMs at 500k concurrency, if workers get killed during
ramp, or if you need to justify a resource bump — read this page first.

---

## Purpose

The estimator answers three related questions:

1. **Will this workload fit in the current memory limits?** Each `PodEstimate`
   carries both the projected peak RSS and the configured K8s limit; the
   `headroom_pct` / `at_risk` properties flag OOM risk before a job is
   submitted.
2. **What limits should I set?** `recommended_request_mib` (steady-state × 1.2)
   and `recommended_limit_mib` (peak × 1.3) come straight off the estimate.
3. **Where is the memory actually going?** Per-component breakdowns identify
   whether `RecordsManager` growable arrays, `RecordProcessor` tokenizer caches,
   or in-flight `Worker` records dominate — so tuning targets the right knob.

The model is static: formulas are derived from code inspection, and the
constants come from two different kinds of calibration (see the provenance
notes on each constant in
`src/aiperf/kubernetes/_memory_estimator/constants.py`). No runtime profiling is
required at estimate time.

- **Aggregate MiB baselines** — `_PYTHON_SUBPROCESS_BASE_MIB`,
  `_SERVICE_BASE_MIB`, `_TOKENIZER_CACHE_MIB`, and the margin multipliers were
  measured against real-cluster `container_memory_working_set_bytes` during the
  2026-04-30 ISL/OSL sweep. Re-derive them only from a new cluster sweep.
- **Per-object byte constants** — `_REQUEST_RECORD_BASE_BYTES`,
  `_TURN_BASE_BYTES`, and the SSE / `TextResponse` terms are measured
  in-process against the real model classes, as *amortized marginal* heap bytes
  per instance via `tracemalloc` snapshot diffs over 1000–3000 live instances
  after a warmup pass. Amortizing is required: the one-off cost of shared
  field-name strings and Pydantic validator objects is paid by the first
  instance and must not be charged to the marginal one. `sys.getsizeof` is not
  usable — it sees only the top-level object and misses `__dict__` /
  `__pydantic_extra__` and every referenced string.

`TestPerRequestBytesAgainstMeasuredHeap` in
`tests/unit/kubernetes/test_memory_estimator.py` re-runs that measurement on
every test run and fails if `_per_request_bytes` drifts off the conservative
side of it, so the per-object constants are reproducible without any external
script.

**Consumers of estimator output:**

- `aiperf kube generate` — prints the full estimate to **stderr** (so stdout
  stays a clean `kubectl apply -f -` stream) after emitting the manifests.
- `aiperf kube profile` — prints the full estimate and warnings to **stderr**
  before submitting the job.
- Operator preflight (`src/aiperf/operator/preflight/_resources.py`) — runs the
  estimator as the `Memory Estimation` check. If `estimate.warnings` is
  non-empty the check returns `WARN` with `estimate.recommendations` as hints;
  it does **not** fail or reject the job.

## Inputs

All inputs are captured in `MemoryEstimationParams`
(`src/aiperf/kubernetes/_memory_estimator/params.py`). They fall into four
groups:

### Topology

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `total_workers` | Total worker processes across all pods. |
| `workers_per_pod` | Worker processes per worker pod. |
| `num_worker_pods` | Worker pod replica count (`ceil(total_workers / workers_per_pod)`). |
| `record_processors_per_pod` | Record processors per worker pod. `benchmark.runtime.record_processors_per_pod` when set, otherwise `max(1, workers_per_pod // RECORD_PROCESSOR_SCALE_FACTOR)`. |

`_derive_topology` reads the same config fields, in the same precedence order,
that `spec_converter.apply_worker_config` uses to lay out the JobSet, so the
estimate always describes the pods that are actually created. The operator calls
`apply_worker_config` before preflight, which normalizes `workers_per_pod` and
`record_processors_per_pod` onto the config first — so the estimate also picks up
the cluster-wide `runtime.record_processors` total (divided across pods) and the
single-pod collapse that a worker count not divisible by `workers_per_pod`
triggers.

The `aiperf kube generate` and `aiperf kube profile --dry-run` banners print
their estimate from the *pre-normalization* config. An explicit
`recordProcessorsPerPod` or `workersPerPod` is honored there, but a bare
`runtime.record_processors` total, and the non-divisible single-pod collapse, are
not yet resolved at that point and so are not reflected in the printed numbers.

### Load profile

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `max_concurrency` | Peak in-flight request concurrency across all workers. |
| `total_requests` | Total requests for the entire benchmark (sum across phases). |
| `total_benchmark_duration_s` | Total benchmark wall-clock seconds. |

### Dataset shape

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `dataset_count` | Number of conversations pre-synthesized. |
| `avg_isl_tokens` | Weighted-mean input sequence length in tokens. |
| `avg_osl_tokens` | Weighted-mean output sequence length in tokens. |
| `max_turns` | Maximum conversation turns (1 for single-turn). |
| `streaming` | SSE vs. buffered-text responses (changes per-chunk accounting). |
| `list_metric_backend` | `ragged` keeps every inter-chunk-latency value; `tdigest` uses one bounded sketch. Derived from `AIPERF_METRICS_LIST_BACKEND`. |

### Observability

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `num_gpus`, `gpu_sample_interval_s`, `num_gpu_metrics` | DCGM sampling shape. |
| `num_server_metrics_endpoints`, `server_metrics_scrape_interval_s` | Prometheus scrape shape. |
| `est_unique_metric_series`, `est_histogram_metrics`, `est_histogram_buckets` | Per-endpoint series cardinality. |
| `num_models`, `num_standard_metrics`, `export_http_trace` | Per-RP tokenizer count, per-record metrics, trace export flag. |

`MemoryEstimationParams.from_config(config, total_workers, workers_per_pod,
connections_per_worker)` is the normal entry point: it derives all of the above
from an `AIPerfConfig` plus three deployment parameters.

---

## Per-component model

Every per-process estimate returns a `ComponentEstimate` (see
`src/aiperf/kubernetes/_memory_estimator/estimates.py`) with four numeric
fields — `base_mib`, `variable_mib`, `peak_mib`, and a derived
`steady_state_mib = base_mib + variable_mib`.

Two universal baselines ride along on every process:

- `_PYTHON_SUBPROCESS_BASE_MIB = 150` — interpreter + core libs + GC + every
  module an AIPerf service loads (numpy, pandas, msgspec, pydantic, orjson,
  aiohttp, ZMQ, asyncio). Calibrated from a real-cluster ISL/OSL sweep
  (2026-04-30) to a ~150 MiB common baseline per container.
- `_PYTHON_CHILD_SUBPROCESS_BASE_MIB = 150` — Worker/RP subprocesses are modeled
  the same as the parent. Copy-on-write does not materially shrink the measured
  working set (`container_memory_working_set_bytes` is per-container, and each
  process's heap diverges quickly once it allocates per-task state).

Each service adds a per-service overhead from `_SERVICE_BASE_MIB` (e.g.
`records_manager: 40`, `dataset_manager: 30`, `worker: 12`,
`record_processor: 10`).

### RecordsManager

Accumulates one metric record per request for the lifetime of the benchmark.
The backing `ColumnStore` includes scalar metric columns, timestamp and
metadata columns, categorical intern tables, and (for streaming runs) the
list-valued `inter_chunk_latency` (ICL) metric. ICL is usually the dominant
term when the default `ragged` backend retains every chunk gap.

Source: `_estimate_records_manager`, `components.py`.

For $N$ requests, $M$ standard metrics, dataset cardinality $D$, and average
output length $O$:

$$C = \max(1024, \text{ceil\_pow2}(N))$$
$$\text{columns} = C \times \left((M - 1 + 3 + 4) \times 8\text{B} + 6 \times 4\text{B} + 2\text{B}\right) \times 1.05$$
$$\text{intern} = (N + \min(N, D)) \times 136\text{B}$$

The column counts model the `MetricsAccumulator.process_record` layout: $M-1$
scalar metrics (the 25th standard metric is list-valued ICL), three request
timestamps, four numeric metadata columns, six categorical `int32` code
columns, and two boolean `uint8` columns. The categorical, boolean, and
timestamp counts match `process_record` exactly. `process_record` passes five
numeric metadata keys (`session_num`, `credit_issued_ns`, `request_ack_ns`,
`cancellation_time_ns`, `turn_index`), but `ColumnStore.ingest_metadata`
allocates a column only for non-`None` values, so the deployed column count is
four for the default streaming workload — three without streaming (no
`request_ack_ns`), five once any request is cancelled.
`_COLUMN_STORE_METADATA_NUMERIC_COLUMNS = 4` therefore models the default, and
`TestColumnStoreMetadataColumnDrift` guards it by driving records through the
real `MetricsAccumulator.process_record` and counting the columns
`ColumnStore` actually allocated. The intern term models a
conservative request-unique `x_correlation_id` plus `conversation_id` values
bounded by dataset cardinality.

When streaming is enabled and `AIPERF_METRICS_LIST_BACKEND=ragged`:

$$S = N \times \max(O - 1, 0)$$
$$\text{ragged} = \max(1024, \text{ceil\_pow2}(S)) \times (8 + 4)\text{B} \times 1.05 + \max(256, \text{ceil\_pow2}(N)) \times 8\text{B}$$

For $S > 0$, the first ragged term holds every ICL value as `float64` and its
request index as `int32`; the second is the per-request `int64` offsets array.
When $S = 0$, no ICL backend is created and the term is zero. Buffered
responses also contribute no ICL storage. With
`AIPERF_METRICS_LIST_BACKEND=tdigest`, the entire ICL term collapses to a
bounded 4 KiB sketch (`_TDIGEST_LIST_BACKEND_BYTES`) regardless of request
count, and to zero when $O \le 1$.

The final variable estimate is `columns + intern + ICL + 1 MiB tracker`.

Key constants:

- `_FLOAT64_BYTES = 8` — numpy element width.
- `_GROWABLE_ARRAY_OVERHEAD = 1.05` — wrapper-class overhead atop the
  numpy-backed array (also reused by GPU-telemetry and server-metrics
  arrays). The doubling-allocator waste is now captured separately
  by `ceil_pow2(N)` in the capacity term, so this multiplier only covers the
  ~0–2% wrapper overhead (dict of metric names, bucket tuple, sum tracker).
- `_DEFAULT_NUM_STANDARD_METRICS = 25` — scalar metrics plus the one
  list-valued ICL metric.
- `_CATEGORICAL_INTERN_BYTES_PER_REQUEST = 136` — calibrated
  high-cardinality string, dictionary slot, and integer-code footprint.
- `ceil_pow2` rounds capacity up to the next power of two (the doubling
  allocator's actual footprint, not the logical request count).

**Peak** applies a 10% finalization overhead on top of variable. Tracker
overhead (`WorkerProcessingStats` per worker) is a flat ~1 MiB.

**Warning:** if `variable_mib > 500` the estimator flags the result. For a
streaming ragged run, the warning also identifies
`AIPERF_METRICS_LIST_BACKEND=tdigest` as the bounded-memory alternative and
notes that its ICL percentiles are approximate.

**Scales with:** `total_requests` (linearly rounded up to a power of two) and
`num_standard_metrics`; with ragged streaming, it also scales with
`total_requests × (avg_osl_tokens - 1)`.

### DatasetManager

Two memory regimes. During generation the full dataset is materialized as
Pydantic `Conversation` objects; at steady state only the mmap index survives.

Source: `_estimate_dataset_manager`, `components.py`.

$$\text{bytes\_per\_turn} = 1500 + (\text{ISL} + \text{OSL}) \times 16$$
$$\text{peak} = \text{base} + \text{dataset\_count} \times \text{max\_turns} \times \text{bytes\_per\_turn}$$
$$\text{steady} = \text{base} + \text{dataset\_count} \times 16\text{B}$$

Key constants:

- `16 bytes/token` — effective token cost after Pydantic model wrappers
  (~1 KiB per `Turn`), Python string headers, and the ~3x multiplier measured
  against ISL=100K OSL=73K with 100 entries (~297 MiB PSS).
- `_MMAP_INDEX_ENTRY_BYTES = 16` — per-conversation index entry at steady
  state.

**Scales with:** `dataset_count`, `max_turns`, `avg_isl + avg_osl`. Generation
peak dominates; steady state is negligible.

### Worker

One process per worker. Memory = connection pool + in-flight request records
+ session cache (multi-turn only).

Source: `_estimate_worker`, `components.py`. Shares the
`_per_request_bytes(avg_isl, avg_osl, *, streaming)` helper with
RecordProcessor so the two stay consistent.

Per in-flight request:

$$\text{per\_request} = \underbrace{3600}_{\text{record base}} + \underbrace{(2240 + \text{ISL} \times 4)}_{\text{turn}} + \text{response}$$

Response depends on streaming mode:

$$\text{response}_{\text{SSE}} = 136 + \text{OSL} \times 420 \qquad \text{response}_{\text{text}} = 152 + \text{OSL} \times 4$$

Pod-level:

$$\text{variable} = \text{pool} + \text{concurrency\_per\_worker} \times \text{per\_request} + \text{session\_cache}$$

Key constants (`constants.py`):

- `_REQUEST_RECORD_BASE_BYTES = 3600` — the Pydantic `RequestRecord` shell plus
  the `RecordContext` it carries, with empty turns/responses lists. Both are
  counted here because `_per_request_bytes` has no separate context term.
  Measured 1125 B bare record + 1896 B `RecordContext`, 3596 B for the
  populated pair.
- `_TURN_BASE_BYTES = 2240`, `_TURN_BYTES_PER_TOKEN = 4` — `Turn` + `Text` with
  an empty content string measured 2235 B (`Turn` alone 1576 B, `Text` alone
  592 B); the prompt text adds a measured 4.01 B/token.
- `_SSE_MESSAGE_BASE_BYTES = 136`, `_SSE_BYTES_PER_CHUNK = 420` — SSE per-token
  cost is ~105x buffered text (420 B/chunk vs 4 B/token). The transport appends
  one whole `SSEMessage` per wire chunk to `RequestRecord.responses`, so the
  marginal cost is a message plus its packets list, its `SSEField`, and the JSON
  string — not a bare `SSEField`. Measured 418.7 B/chunk against the
  OpenAI-compatible chunk envelope this repo's mock server emits; a minimal
  `{"c":"<n>"}` envelope measures 286 B/chunk, so the per-chunk cost is
  dominated by the provider's envelope rather than by the token.
- `_TEXT_RESPONSE_BASE_BYTES = 152`, `_TEXT_RESPONSE_BYTES_PER_TOKEN = 4` — the
  `TextResponse` `@dataclass(slots=True)` shell measured 86 B, so the base errs
  high by a small and deliberate margin; the body adds a measured 4.00 B/token.
- `_BYTES_PER_CONNECTION = 1024` — aiohttp per-connection kernel + userspace
  buffers.

`RequestRecord` and `Turn` are Pydantic `AIPerfBaseModel` subclasses
(`extra="allow"`, so each instance carries `__dict__` + `__pydantic_extra__` +
`__pydantic_fields_set__`); `TextResponse`, `SSEMessage`, and `SSEField` are
`@dataclass(slots=True)` and much cheaper. The record and turn constants were
originally derived assuming `msgspec.Struct` layout, which left them 2.2–5.4x
low, and `_SSE_BYTES_PER_CHUNK` was fitted against a one-message-many-packets
shape the transport never builds. Both were corrected on 2026-08-24; the
prediction now lands at 1.01–1.07x of measured across streaming and buffered
shapes at ISL=512/OSL=128 and ISL=1024/OSL=1024.

Session cache activates when `max_turns > 1`: prior-turn prompts stay resident
for the session duration.

**Scales with:** `max_concurrency / total_workers`, `avg_osl`, streaming mode,
`max_turns`, `connections_per_worker`.

### RecordProcessor

One process per RP; `record_processors_per_pod` copies live in each worker
pod. Memory = tokenizer cache + in-flight records + raw-batch and
export-batch buffers.

Source: `_estimate_record_processor`, `components.py`.

$$\text{variable} = \underbrace{\text{num\_models} \times 150}_{\text{tokenizer}} + \underbrace{\text{rp\_queue\_depth} \times \text{per\_record}}_{\text{inflight}} + \text{raw\_buf} + \text{export\_buf}$$

Key constants:

- `_TOKENIZER_CACHE_MIB = 150` — per distinct model (GPT-2 ~73 MiB, Llama-3
  ~50–100 MiB, large SentencePiece models ~150 MiB).
- `_RAW_BATCH_SIZE = 10`, `_EXPORT_BATCH_SIZE = 100`,
  `_EXPORT_BYTES_PER_RECORD = 1100` (module-local in `components.py`).

**Queue-depth amplification at high token counts** — the
`_rp_queue_depth(conc_per_rp, isl, osl)` helper in `estimator.py` models the
fact that tokenization becomes the bottleneck for ISL+OSL > 10K. Records pile
up in the RP's unbounded ZMQ pull queue as fully deserialized Python objects:

$$\text{rp\_queue\_depth} = \begin{cases} \text{conc\_per\_rp} \times \min\!\left(\tfrac{\text{ISL}+\text{OSL}}{10000}, 10\right) & \text{if ISL}+\text{OSL} > 10{,}000 \\ \text{conc\_per\_rp} & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$

Calibrated against PSS: at ISL+OSL=173K the queue reaches ~150 records per RP
(10x base). This is the mechanism by which large-token benchmarks OOM worker
pods even at moderate concurrency.

**Warnings:** triggers on `inflight_mib > 50` (high token pressure) or
`tokenizer_mib > 450` (too many models loaded per RP).

**Scales with:** `num_models`, `concurrency_per_rp` (amplified by token
count), streaming mode, `avg_isl + avg_osl`.

### ServerMetrics

Prometheus scrape history, one time series per metric per endpoint, held in
growable arrays identical in shape to RecordsManager.

Source: `_estimate_server_metrics`, `components.py`.

$$\text{scalar\_bytes} = \text{scalar\_count} \times \text{ceil\_pow2}(\text{n\_scrapes}) \times 16\text{B}$$
$$\text{hist\_bytes} = \text{hist\_count} \times \text{ceil\_pow2}(\text{n\_scrapes}) \times (24 + \text{buckets} \times 8)\text{B}$$
$$\text{variable} = \text{num\_endpoints} \times (\text{scalar} + \text{hist} + \text{fetch}) \times 1.05$$

Key constants (`constants.py`):

- `_DEFAULT_SCRAPE_INTERVAL_S = 5.0`
- `_DEFAULT_UNIQUE_METRIC_SERIES = 200`,
  `_DEFAULT_HISTOGRAM_METRICS = 20`,
  `_DEFAULT_HISTOGRAM_BUCKETS = 10`.

Returns zero if `num_endpoints == 0` (server metrics disabled).

**Scales with:** `num_endpoints`, `duration_s / scrape_interval_s`,
`unique_series`, `histogram_buckets`.

### GPUTelemetry

DCGM samples held as columnar numpy arrays, one per metric per GPU.

Source: `_estimate_gpu_telemetry`, `components.py`.

$$\text{per\_gpu\_bytes} = \text{ceil\_pow2}(\text{n\_samples}) \times 8 + \text{num\_metrics} \times \text{ceil\_pow2}(\text{n\_samples}) \times 8$$
$$\text{variable} = \text{num\_gpus} \times \text{per\_gpu\_bytes} \times 1.05$$

Key constants:

- `_DEFAULT_GPU_METRICS = 12` (DCGM default set).
- `gpu_sample_interval_s = 1.0` (default in `params.py`).
- `_GROWABLE_ARRAY_OVERHEAD = 1.05` — applied as a single multiplier to the
  total GPU telemetry footprint (same constant as RecordsManager). The
  `formula` string this component reports interpolates the constant, so the
  display and the arithmetic cannot diverge.

Returns zero when `num_gpus == 0` — no DCGM URLs, or GPU telemetry disabled.
The operator omits the container entirely in that case.

**Scales with:** `num_gpus`, `duration_s / sample_interval_s`,
`num_gpu_metrics`.

### Fixed-overhead services

`SystemController`, `TimingManager`, `APIService`, `ResultsSidecar` (on the
controller pod) and `WorkerGroupManager` (on each worker pod) all use
`_estimate_fixed_service`: a flat `_SERVICE_BASE_MIB[name] +
_PYTHON_SUBPROCESS_BASE_MIB` with `variable_mib = 0`. These do not scale with
workload.

Plus 3 ZMQ proxies at 5 MiB each (`_ZMQ_PROXY_MIB = 5`,
`_NUM_ZMQ_PROXIES = 3`) on the controller pod.

---

## Output schema

`estimate_memory(config, ...)` returns a `ClusterMemoryEstimate`:

```
ClusterMemoryEstimate
├── params: MemoryEstimationParams        # echoed inputs
├── controller: PodEstimate
│   ├── components: list[ComponentEstimate]   # per-service breakdown
│   ├── current_limit_mib: float              # configured K8s limit
│   ├── replicas: int
│   ├── total_steady_state_mib (property)
│   ├── total_peak_mib (property)
│   ├── recommended_request_mib (property)    # steady x 1.2
│   ├── recommended_limit_mib (property)      # peak x 1.3
│   ├── headroom_pct (property)
│   └── at_risk (property)                    # headroom < 15%
├── worker_pod: PodEstimate                   # single-pod, multiplied by replicas
├── operator: PodEstimate                     # fixed 256 MiB
├── warnings: list[str]                       # fixed emission order
└── recommendations: list[str]                # actionable tuning suggestions
```

The `replicas` field on `worker_pod` is the number of worker pods; use
`worker_pod.total_steady_state_mib * worker_pod.replicas` for the cluster-wide
worker footprint.

Every `ComponentEstimate` also carries a `formula` string and a
`dominant_factor` string that spell out how its number was derived. Neither is
rendered by `format_estimate()` in `formatting.py` — the report that
`aiperf kube profile` prints shows the topology header, per-pod steady/peak
tables with a `[!]` marker on warned components, the cluster total, and then
the `warnings` and `recommendations` lists. Read `formula` programmatically if
you need the breakdown.

---

## OOM risk warnings

The estimator attaches warnings at two layers.

### Per-component (attached to `ComponentEstimate.warning`)

| Component | Trigger | Message pattern |
|---|---|---|
| RecordsManager | `variable_mib > 500` | `"variable memory is X MiB ... consider reducing request count"` |
| RecordProcessor | `inflight_mib > 50` | `"in-flight records use X MiB ... driven by <mode> ISL=... OSL=... at concurrency N"` |
| RecordProcessor | `tokenizer_mib > 450` | `"tokenizer cache is X MiB ... consider reducing model count"` |

`ComponentEstimate.warning` holds at most one string, so the two RecordProcessor
triggers are mutually exclusive: when both conditions hold, the in-flight
message wins and the tokenizer message is suppressed.

### Per-cluster (appended to `ClusterMemoryEstimate.warnings`)

| Warning | Trigger (constant) | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| Controller pod at risk | `headroom_pct < 15%` (`_HEADROOM_WARNING_PCT`) | Peak is within 15% of limit; OOM likely. |
| RecordsManager dominates controller | RM > 50% of controller limit (`_RECORDS_MANAGER_WARN_PCT`) | Request count is the single largest driver. |
| Worker pod at risk | `headroom_pct < 15%` | Per-pod peak too close to limit. |
| High request volume | `total_requests > 500_000` | Expect significant metric array storage. |
| Many models per RP | `num_models * 150 > 450 MiB` | Tokenizer cache will dominate each RP. |
| HTTP trace at scale | `export_http_trace and total_requests > 10_000` | Per-chunk trace data accumulates unboundedly. |
| Multi-turn with heavy concurrency | `max_turns > 1 and sessions_per_worker > 100` | Session cache may grow significantly. |

`recommendations` are built by `_build_recommendations(est)` — it prints the
specific `recommended_limit_mib` values to bump to, or confirms that current
limits have adequate headroom.

---

## How to run it

### Programmatic

```python
import yaml

from aiperf.config.config import AIPerfConfig
from aiperf.kubernetes.memory_estimator import estimate_memory, format_estimate

with open("bench.yaml") as fh:
    config = AIPerfConfig.model_validate(yaml.safe_load(fh))

est = estimate_memory(
    config,
    total_workers=10,
    workers_per_pod=None,      # None = config.benchmark.runtime.workers_per_pod,
                               # else AIPERF_WORKER_DEFAULT_WORKERS_PER_POD
    connections_per_worker=200,
)
print(format_estimate(est))

if est.controller.at_risk:
    raise SystemExit(
        f"Controller would OOM: need {est.controller.recommended_limit_mib} MiB, "
        f"have {est.controller.current_limit_mib:.0f} MiB"
    )
```

### Via CLI

`aiperf kube profile` derives `MemoryEstimationParams.from_config(...)` from
the rendered config and prints the full report to **stderr** — including
per-pod tables, warnings, and recommendations — before any cluster resources
are created.

`aiperf kube generate` runs the same estimate and prints it to **stderr**
after writing the manifests to stdout. The rendered manifests take their
`resources.requests` / `resources.limits` from the `AIPERF_K8S_*` resource
settings, not from `recommended_request_mib` / `recommended_limit_mib` — read
the report, then set the env vars yourself if it says you need to.

The operator preflight step (`src/aiperf/operator/preflight/_resources.py`)
runs the estimator once more as the `Memory Estimation` check. Any estimator
warning downgrades that check to `WARN` and attaches `recommendations` as
hints; it never blocks admission.

---

## Tuning recipes

### "My records-manager OOMs at 500k concurrency"

1. Run `aiperf kube profile` and look at the `RecordsManager` row in the
   Controller Pod table.
2. If `RecordsManager uses N% of controller limit` appears in warnings, read
   that component's `formula` string (not printed by the report — see
   [Output schema](#output-schema)): it separates fixed `ColumnStore` columns,
   categorical intern entries, and ICL storage. For streaming runs, ragged ICL
   scales as `requests × (OSL - 1)` and can dominate by gigabytes.
3. If exact ICL percentiles and ICL-aware sweep curves are not required, set
   `AIPERF_METRICS_LIST_BACKEND=tdigest`. This bounds ICL aggregation to about
   4 KiB while retaining exact count/sum/min/max/average/std and approximate
   percentiles. Otherwise, provision for the ragged estimate.
4. Bump `AIPERF_K8S_RECORDS_MANAGER_MEMORY` (and `AIPERF_K8S_RECORDS_MANAGER_CPU`)
   on the operator. `current_limit_mib` for the controller pod is the **sum** of
   the memory limits across `CONTROLLER_RESOURCE_KEYS` (see
   `aiperf.kubernetes.environment`), so raise that sum until it clears the
   pod-level `recommended_limit_mib`.

### "Workers OOM mid-ramp on a large-token workload"

Check the RecordProcessor warning first. If `in-flight records use X MiB` fires
with `ISL+OSL > 10_000`, you have hit the tokenization-queue-depth
amplification — at ISL+OSL=173K the queue reaches 10x `conc_per_rp`. Options:

- Raise `--total-workers`. In the estimator's model `conc_per_rp` reduces to
  `max_concurrency / total_workers` at the default
  `AIPERF_K8S_RECORD_PROCESSOR_SCALE_FACTOR=1` (one RP per worker), because
  `workers_per_pod` scales the pod's concurrency and its RP count by the same
  factor — increasing `workers_per_pod` alone does not move the number.
- Bump the worker pod's memory limit (`AIPERF_K8S_WORKER_POD_MEMORY`) to the
  estimator's `recommended_limit_mib`.
- Lower `benchmark.runtime.record_processors_per_pod`. This packs fewer RPs into
  each pod, and the estimate follows it: at the default scale factor, dropping
  from one RP per worker to a single RP on a 4-worker pod removes roughly 975 MiB
  of peak per-pod RP memory. It raises `conc_per_rp` in exchange, so re-read the
  RecordProcessor warning afterwards.

### "Tokenizer cache dominates each RP"

Triggered by `num_models * 150 MiB > 450 MiB`. Either split models across
separate AIPerfJob CRs (one model per benchmark) or accept the higher
worker-pod memory limit — there is no per-process cache deduplication.

### "The estimator disagrees with measured RSS"

Constants are calibrated but static. Which class of constant is wrong decides
how to fix it:

- **A per-object byte constant.** Re-measure it. Extend
  `TestPerRequestBytesAgainstMeasuredHeap` in
  `tests/unit/kubernetes/test_memory_estimator.py` with your shape, read the
  measured value out of the assertion message, and update the constant. The
  test enforces `1.0 <= predicted / measured <= 1.6`, so a prediction that
  lands *below* measured is a bug and a prediction slightly above it is
  correct — the output is a limit recommendation. The per-chunk SSE cost is
  dominated by the provider's chunk envelope, so a server with unusually large
  chunks (per-chunk `usage`, `logprobs`) will legitimately exceed the model.
- **An aggregate MiB baseline.** These come from a real-cluster
  `container_memory_working_set_bytes` sweep and cannot be re-derived
  in-process. Update them only from a new cluster measurement.

Record the provenance in the constant's comment the way the existing ones do —
state the method, the date, and the shape measured. Do not edit the formulas
ad-hoc.
