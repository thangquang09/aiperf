# CRD Validation Rules

When you `kubectl apply` an `AIPerfJob` or `AIPerfSweep` CR, the Kubernetes
apiserver runs two layers of validation **before** the operator ever sees the
resource:

1. **Structural schema** — types, enums, `minimum`/`maximum`, `required`. If
   this layer rejects, the resource is never persisted.
2. **CEL `x-kubernetes-validations`** — cross-field invariants compiled into
   the CRD. These mirror the Pydantic `@model_validator` rules on the
   underlying config models (`EndpointConfig`, `RuntimeConfig`,
   `MultiRunConfig`) and on `AIPerfJobSpec` / `AIPerfSweepSpec`, but fire at
   admission time so a bad CR is rejected with a clear message before any pod
   is scheduled.

The CRD that defines both layers is auto-generated from the `AIPerfJobSpec` and
`AIPerfSweepSpec` Pydantic models in `src/aiperf/kubernetes/crd_models.py` —
see [the dev flow doc](../dev/kubernetes-flow.md#crd-generator)
for how to add new rules.

The lifecycle fields `spec.cancel` and `spec.skipEndpointCheck` are native
booleans, and `spec.ttlSecondsAfterFinished` is a nonnegative integer. Quoted
forms such as `cancel: "false"` or `ttlSecondsAfterFinished: "300"` are rejected
at admission. Cancellation and retention handlers consume raw Kubernetes spec
values, so native schema typing is part of the lifecycle safety boundary.

## Shorthand acceptance

The whole structural `required` chain is `spec: [benchmark]`,
`spec.benchmark: [endpoint]`, `endpoint: [urls]`, and `spec.benchmark` carries
an **empty** `x-kubernetes-validations: []` block. `models` and every
shorthand sibling (`model`, `dataset`, `warmup`, `profiling`) are typeless
`x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields` properties; `datasets` and `phases` are
`type: array` with opaque preserve-unknown items (`datasets` additionally
carries `minItems: 1` / `maxItems: 1` because the runtime loads exactly one
dataset, `phases` carries `minItems: 1`). No CEL rule requires or excludes any
of them: a typeless field cannot be `has()`-ed and opaque array items cannot be
dereferenced. So the apiserver accepts either idiom, and the operator's
before-validator does the actual shorthand↔canonical normalization on
reconcile. This means **kubectl apply accepts the CLI-YAML idiom** without
rewriting:

```yaml
# Shorthand form — accepted by the apiserver, normalized by the operator's
# before-validator on reconcile.
spec:
  benchmark:
    endpoint:
      urls: ["http://server:8000/v1/chat/completions"]
      type: chat
    model: meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct  # singular, scalar
    dataset:                                 # singular, dict
      type: synthetic
    profiling:                               # phase shorthand
      type: concurrency
```

```yaml
# Canonical form — also accepted; same post-normalization shape, except that
# the `dataset:` shorthand above injects `name: default` rather than `main`.
spec:
  benchmark:
    endpoint:
      urls: ["http://server:8000/v1/chat/completions"]
      type: chat
    models: [meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct]
    datasets:
    - name: main
      type: synthetic
    phases:
    - name: profiling
      type: concurrency
```

One more node is deliberately typeless for the same reason:
`spec.benchmark.artifacts.userFiles[].content`. A user file's body is a bare
string for `format: text` and a dict/list/scalar otherwise, so no single
`type:` matches every legal value. The node carries
`x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields: true` with no `type`, and the
format↔content pairing is enforced by the `UserFile` Pydantic validators on
reconcile. `path` and `content` stay structurally `required`.

You **cannot** mix the two forms for the same slot — the operator's
`normalize_before_validation` raises a Pydantic ``ValueError`` on reconcile
(`status.phase=Failed` with `'dataset' cannot be used with 'datasets'. Use
'dataset' for a single dataset or 'datasets' for multiple named datasets.`).
The check can't move to CEL because the shorthand fields are typeless
preserve-unknown siblings — see
[Operator-side (Pydantic) invariants](#operator-side-pydantic-invariants) below.

## Rule catalog

The tables below list **only the CEL rules `tools/generate_crd.py` actually
emits** (verified against the generated `crd-aiperfjob.yaml` /
`crd-aiperfsweep.yaml`). Each entry gives the verbatim CEL expression and the
message users see on rejection. Cross-field invariants that CEL cannot express
are enforced by Pydantic on the operator side instead — see
[Operator-side (Pydantic) invariants](#operator-side-pydantic-invariants) below.

### Endpoint rules — `spec.benchmark.endpoint` (both kinds)

| CEL rule | Message |
|---|---|
| `!has(self.type) \|\| self.type != 'template' \|\| has(self.template)` | `endpoint.template is required when endpoint.type='template'` |
| `!has(self.template) \|\| !has(self.type) \|\| self.type == 'template'` | `endpoint.template is only used when endpoint.type='template' (omit type to have it inferred)` |
| `!has(self.requestContentType) \|\| self.requestContentType != 'multipart/form-data' \|\| !has(self.type) \|\| self.type in ['audio_transcription', 'image_edit', 'video_generation']` | `requestContentType='multipart/form-data' is only supported on endpoint types that accept form data: audio_transcription, image_edit, video_generation` |
| `!has(self.path) \|\| self.path.startsWith('/')` | `endpoint.path must start with '/' (e.g. '/v1/chat/completions', not 'v1/chat/completions')` |

The form-data endpoint list in the third rule is derived at generation time
from the `requires_form_data` plugin metadata in
`src/aiperf/plugin/plugins.yaml`, so it cannot drift from the Pydantic gate.

### Runtime rules — `spec.benchmark.runtime` (both kinds)

| CEL rule | Message |
|---|---|
| `!has(self.apiHost) \|\| has(self.apiPort)` | `runtime.apiHost requires runtime.apiPort to be set` |
| `!has(self.workersMin) \|\| !has(self.workers) \|\| int(self.workersMin) <= int(self.workers)` | `runtime.workersMin must be <= runtime.workers` |

### MultiRun rules — `spec.multiRun` (both kinds)

| CEL rule | Message |
|---|---|
| `!has(self.convergence) \|\| !has(self.convergence.minRuns) \|\| !has(self.numRuns) \|\| self.convergence.minRuns <= self.numRuns` | `multiRun.convergence.minRuns must be <= multiRun.numRuns; either lower minRuns or raise numRuns` |

> No CEL rule is attached to `spec.benchmark.artifacts` on either kind.

### AIPerfJob spec-level rules

| CEL rule | Path | Message |
|---|---|---|
| `!has(self.sweep)` | `spec` | `AIPerfJob.spec.sweep must be null/omitted. Use kind: AIPerfSweep for parameter sweeps.` |
| `!has(self.multiRun) \|\| ((!has(self.multiRun.numRuns) \|\| self.multiRun.numRuns <= 1) && !has(self.multiRun.convergence))` | `spec` | `AIPerfJob.spec.multiRun must describe one run without convergence. Use kind: AIPerfSweep for multi-run orchestration.` |

### AIPerfSweep spec-level rules

| CEL rule | Path | Message |
|---|---|---|
| `has(self.sweep)` | `spec` | `AIPerfSweep.spec.sweep is required. Use kind: AIPerfJob for single benchmarks.` |

### Workload update rules

Create-time workload fields use this presence-safe transition rule on the
parent `spec` node:

| CEL rule template | Path | Message template |
|---|---|---|
| `has(oldSelf.<field>) == has(self.<field>) && (!has(self.<field>) \|\| oldSelf.<field> == self.<field>)` | `spec` | `spec.<field> is immutable after creation; create a new <kind> to change it` |

Keeping the rule on `spec`, which exists on every update, is intentional.
A transition rule attached to an optional field is not evaluated when that
field is added or removed. The explicit `has` parity rejects a value change,
first-set-after-create, and removal. Kubernetes evaluates rules using
`oldSelf` only on updates, so initial creation remains unrestricted.

The exact update contract is:

| Kind | Mutable after creation | Immutable after creation |
|---|---|---|
| `AIPerfJob` | `cancel`, `timeoutSeconds` | `image`, `imagePullPolicy`, `resourceMode`, `connectionsPerWorker`, `ttlSecondsAfterFinished`, `resultsTtlDays`, `keepFailedPods`, `podTemplate`, `scheduling`, `schemaVersion`, `benchmark`, `sweep`, `multiRun`, `plot`, `variables`, `randomSeed`, `noSweepTable`, `skipEndpointCheck`, `failurePolicy` |
| `AIPerfSweep` | `cancel`, `ttlSecondsAfterFinished` | `image`, `imagePullPolicy`, `resourceMode`, `connectionsPerWorker`, `timeoutSeconds`, `resultsTtlDays`, `keepFailedPods`, `podTemplate`, `scheduling`, `schemaVersion`, `benchmark`, `sweep`, `multiRun`, `plot`, `variables`, `randomSeed`, `noSweepTable`, `skipEndpointCheck`, `failurePolicy`, `childMetadata` |

The mutable whitelist follows the live reconciliation paths. The AIPerfJob
monitor rereads `timeoutSeconds`; both kinds watch or poll `cancel`; and the
operator's parent-sweep reaper rereads `ttlSecondsAfterFinished`. Every other
field is rendered into the ConfigMap, JobSet, serialized sweep plan, or child
template during creation. Accepting updates to those fields would change the
CR without changing the running workload and could make
`status.observedGeneration` falsely acknowledge a configuration the pods never
received.

> The `spec.sweep` absence rule is **AIPerfJob-only**; the AIPerfSweep CRD
> instead asserts `spec.sweep` is present. `spec.benchmark` carries an empty
> `x-kubernetes-validations: []` on both kinds.

## Operator-side (Pydantic) invariants

Several cross-field invariants **cannot** be expressed in CEL — either the
fields they reference are typeless preserve-unknown siblings (`model`,
`dataset`, `warmup`, `profiling`), or the `phases[]` / `datasets[]` array items
are emitted as opaque `x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields` blobs (they are
heterogeneous Pydantic discriminated unions). CEL `has(self.X)` won't compile
against a typeless field, and opaque array items cannot be dereferenced. These
checks stay in the operator's `@model_validator` decorators and surface only on
reconcile (they are also run client-side by `aiperf kube validate`):

| Python validator (`src/aiperf/config/config.py` unless noted) | What it enforces |
|---|---|
| `normalize_before_validation` (via `normalizers._check_mutual_exclusivity`) | shorthand↔canonical mutual exclusion (`model`/`models`, `dataset`/`datasets`, `warmup`+`profiling`/`phases`), plus `warmup` without `profiling` |
| `parse_phases` | `phases` must already be a list by validation time (the dict shape is rejected with a migration pointer) |
| `parse_datasets` → `parse_datasets_input` (`loader/normalizers.py`) | each `datasets[]` entry is a mapping with a required `name` |
| `validate_phase_names_unique` | duplicate phase names within `phases` |
| `validate_profiling_phase_required` | at least one non-warmup profiling phase |
| `validate_seamless_not_on_first_phase` | first phase may not set `seamless=true` |
| `validate_phase_dataset_compatibility` | each phase is compatible with its resolved dataset |
| `validate_prefill_requires_streaming` | a phase with `prefill_concurrency` requires `endpoint.streaming=true` |
| `validate_sweep_no_dashboard_ui` | `sweep` set ⇒ `runtime.ui` is not `dashboard` |
| `_apply_consistent_seed_default` | auto-fills a consistent random seed for cross-trial sweeps when none is given |
| `_validate_image_non_empty` (`kubernetes/crd_models.py`) | `spec.image` is non-blank (the CRD also enforces `minLength: 1`, but that accepts `" "`) |
| `_reject_orchestration_on_aiperfjob` (`kubernetes/crd_models.py`) | AIPerfJob rejects sweep and multi-run orchestration (mirrors its two kind-specific CEL rules) |
| `_require_sweep_on_aiperfsweep` (`kubernetes/crd_models.py`) | AIPerfSweep requires a `sweep` block (mirrors the `has(self.sweep)` CEL rule) |
| `_reject_non_finite_sweep_knobs` (`kubernetes/crd_models.py`) | rejects NaN/inf on `sweep.cooldownSeconds`, `sweep.plateauThreshold`, `sweep.slaWarmupSeconds` |
| `_reject_repeated_iteration_with_convergence` (`kubernetes/crd_models.py`) | AIPerfSweep rejects `sweep.iterationOrder='repeated'` together with `multiRun.convergence` |
| `_resolve_format` / `_validate_path` (`config/user_files.py`) | `artifacts.userFiles[]` format↔content pairing (`text` needs a string, `json`/`yaml` need structured content) and path safety (relative, no `..`, no control chars) — `content` is typeless in the CRD so CEL cannot type-check it |

> There is no `validate_datasets_unique_names` or `validate_dataset_references`
> validator — dataset-name presence is checked by `parse_datasets_input` and
> phase↔dataset coupling by `validate_phase_dataset_compatibility`.

If you submit a CR that the apiserver accepts but the operator later rejects,
the failure shows up as `status.phase=Failed` with the validation error in
`status.error` (or in operator pod logs).

## Example error messages

Each CEL rejection names the rule that fired, so the failure points directly
at what to fix.

```text
$ kubectl apply -f bad-template.yaml
The AIPerfJob "x" is invalid: spec.benchmark.endpoint: Invalid value: "object":
  endpoint.template is required when endpoint.type='template'

$ kubectl apply -f sweep-as-job.yaml
The AIPerfJob "x" is invalid: spec: Invalid value: "object":
  AIPerfJob.spec.sweep must be null/omitted. Use kind: AIPerfSweep for
  parameter sweeps.

$ kubectl apply -f job-as-sweep.yaml
The AIPerfSweep "x" is invalid: spec: Invalid value: "object":
  AIPerfSweep.spec.sweep is required. Use kind: AIPerfJob for single
  benchmarks.
```

The shorthand↔canonical mutual-exclusion error is **not** a CEL rejection at
`kubectl apply`; it surfaces on reconcile as `status.phase=Failed` with the
Pydantic message `'dataset' cannot be used with 'datasets'. Use 'dataset' for
a single dataset or 'datasets' for multiple named datasets.`

## Extending the rule set

Adding a new CEL rule is a small change in `tools/generate_crd.py`:

1. Decide which **shape** the rule applies to (benchmark, endpoint, runtime,
   multiRun) and pick the matching `_decorate_*_node` helper, or add a new
   shape detector if your target node has a unique property fingerprint.
2. Append a `{"rule": ..., "message": ...}` entry to that helper's
   `_add_validation_rules(...)` call.
3. Add a structural assertion to
   `tests/unit/operator/test_aiperfsweep_crd_generation.py`.

   A shape detector keys off property names, so **renaming a field silently
   retires every rule attached to its node** — the detector stops matching and
   the generator reports nothing. Two decorators had been inert this way. When
   you rename or nest a spec field, re-read the detector that fingerprints it,
   and prefer a structural test that asserts the rule is present on both kinds
   over one that only asserts a rule's text.
4. Regenerate (`uv run python tools/generate_crd.py`) and verify the regen
   is idempotent (`tools/generate_crd.py --check`).
5. Round-trip against a real apiserver (kind cluster + `kubectl apply
   --dry-run=server`) — the CEL compiler runs at CRD-install time and will
   reject rules that reference undeclared fields or opaque items.

CEL constraints that aren't obvious from the Pydantic side:

- `has(self.X)` only works on properties that are **declared** in the
  schema. Properties under `x-kubernetes-preserve-unknown-fields` are
  invisible to CEL.
- Array items emitted as opaque preserve-unknown blobs cannot be
  dereferenced (no `phases[].name`, no `phases[0].seamless`).
- `oldSelf` is only available in transition rules and triggers on update.
  Use `!has(oldSelf.X) || oldSelf.X == self.X` for "first-set freezes"
  semantics.
- The K8s apiserver compiles CEL at CRD install time; rule errors fail
  the install with a clear `compilation failed: undefined field 'X'`
  message.
