# YAML Configuration Files

## Overview

AIPerf can be driven entirely from a single YAML file instead of a long string of CLI flags. The YAML format is more readable, easier to version-control, and unlocks features that have no CLI equivalent — sweeps, multi-run aggregation, environment variable substitution, and computed values.

This tutorial walks through what a config file looks like, how to grow it from a tiny example to a full sweep, and how it compares to running everything through `aiperf profile` flags.

You don't need to choose between the two: CLI flags still work, and they layer on top of a YAML file when you pass both.

## Why use a YAML config?

A typical concurrency sweep on the command line looks like this:

```bash
aiperf profile \
  --model meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct \
  --url http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  --endpoint-type chat --streaming \
  --synthetic-input-tokens-mean 512 --synthetic-input-tokens-stddev 0 \
  --output-tokens-mean 128 --output-tokens-stddev 0 \
  --concurrency 8,16,32,64 \
  --request-count 500 \
  --warmup-request-count 50 \
  --artifact-dir ./artifacts/my-test
```

The same run as a YAML file:

```yaml
# benchmark.yaml
schemaVersion: "2.0"

benchmark:
  model: meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
  endpoint:
    url: http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions
    type: chat
    streaming: true
  dataset:
    type: synthetic
    entries: 500
    prompts: {isl: 512, osl: 128}
  phases:
    - {name: warmup, type: concurrency, concurrency: 8, requests: 50, exclude_from_results: true}
    - {name: profiling, type: concurrency, requests: 500}
  artifacts:
    dir: ./artifacts/my-test

sweep:
  type: grid
  parameters:
    concurrency: [8, 16, 32, 64]
```

Run it with:

```bash
aiperf profile --config benchmark.yaml
```

Note the two `500`s map to different things. The CLI's `--request-count 500` is the *stop condition* — keep firing until 500 requests complete — and corresponds to `phases.profiling.requests: 500`. The `dataset.entries: 500` is the *dataset size* — how many unique synthetic prompts to generate up front — and has no CLI shorthand; it's recycled across requests if the phase runs longer than the dataset. They happen to share a value here but tune independently.

What you gain over the flag form:

- **It's all in one place** and you can comment it. No more lost shell history.
- **Sweeps are first-class.** Grid, lockstep zip, named scenarios, and quasi-random search all work out of the box.
- **You can substitute values** from environment variables (`${VAR:default}`) and compute values with simple expressions (`{{ var * 2 }}`).
- **Editors validate as you type** if you wire up the bundled JSON Schema.
- **Errors are kinder.** Misspelled keys produce a "did you mean...?" hint instead of being silently ignored.

## Your first config — five lines that actually work

The smallest legal config is short:

```yaml
# minimal.yaml
schemaVersion: "2.0"

benchmark:
  model: meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
  endpoint:
    url: http://localhost:8000
  dataset:
    type: synthetic
    entries: 100
    prompts: {isl: 512, osl: 128}
  phases:
    type: concurrency
    concurrency: 8
    requests: 100
```

Then:

```bash
aiperf profile --config minimal.yaml
```

That's a complete benchmark — model, endpoint, dataset, and one profiling phase. The endpoint path (`/v1/chat/completions`) is auto-detected from `endpoint.type` (defaulting to `chat`).

You can scaffold this exact file from the bundle without typing it:

```bash
aiperf config init --template minimal --output minimal.yaml
```

`aiperf config init --list` prints every bundled template, grouped by category.

## Anatomy of a config

A YAML config has two layers:

```yaml
# --- envelope (cross-run knobs) ---
schemaVersion: "2.0"
random_seed: 42
variables: {...}
sweep: {...}
multi_run: {...}

# --- benchmark body (the workload itself) ---
benchmark:
  model: ...
  endpoint: {...}
  dataset: {...}
  phases: [...]
```

The **envelope** holds settings that apply across runs — sweep definitions, multi-run aggregation, the random seed, and reusable variables.

The **`benchmark:` body** holds everything that defines a single benchmark workload. When a sweep is active, this body is what gets varied across runs.

### Shorthand vs named forms

Short configs use singular keys. Bigger configs use plural lists with names:

```yaml
# Shorthand — fastest to read for simple cases
benchmark:
  model: meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
  dataset: {type: synthetic, prompts: {isl: 512, osl: 128}}
  phases: {type: concurrency, concurrency: 8, requests: 100}
```

```yaml
# Named — clearer for phases or models; datasets are currently limited to one entry
benchmark:
  models: [meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct]
  datasets:
    - {name: main, type: synthetic, prompts: {isl: 512, osl: 128}}
  phases:
    - {name: warmup, type: concurrency, concurrency: 4, requests: 50, exclude_from_results: true}
    - {name: profiling, type: poisson, rate: 30.0, duration: 120}
```

You can mix and match — the loader auto-expands `model:` into a one-element `models:` list, `dataset:` into a one-entry `datasets:` list named `default`, and a flat `phases:` block into a one-element list named `profiling`. The normalized `datasets:` form is future-facing but currently accepts exactly one dataset; multiple datasets are a roadmap item.

### Inline datasets

Instead of pointing at a `prompts.jsonl` file with `dataset.path:`, you can embed records directly in the YAML:

```yaml
benchmark:
  dataset:
    type: file
    format: single_turn
    records:
      - {text: "What is machine learning?"}
      - {text: "Explain GANs.", output_length: 200}
```

Useful for shareable repros, k8s ConfigMaps, and small regression fixtures. See [Inline Datasets](inline-datasets.md) for full coverage including multi-turn, random_pool (with multi-pool dict-of-lists), and mooncake_trace examples.

### Both naming styles work

AIPerf accepts either `snake_case` or `camelCase` for any field. These two are equivalent:

```yaml
multi_run: {num_runs: 3, cooldown_seconds: 15.0}
```

```yaml
multiRun: {numRuns: 3, cooldownSeconds: 15.0}
```

Pick one and stick with it within a file.

## Editor autocomplete and validation

A bundled JSON Schema gives you autocomplete, type-checking, and inline docs in any editor that speaks YAML language server (VS Code, JetBrains, Vim/Neovim with `coc-yaml`, Helix, etc.). The schema lives at `src/aiperf/config/schema/aiperf-config.schema.json` in the AIPerf repo. Copy or symlink it next to your config and point your editor at it with a relative path:

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=./aiperf-config.schema.json
```

Now the editor will:

- Suggest valid keys as you type.
- Underline misspelled fields in red.
- Show field descriptions on hover.
- Catch type errors (e.g. setting `concurrency: "eight"` instead of `8`).

If your editor already has a workspace mapping for `**/aiperf-config.yaml` or `**/benchmark.yaml`, you can skip the header. See `src/aiperf/config/schema/README.md` for VS Code workspace and IntelliJ configuration examples.

## Helpful errors when you typo

Top-level envelope keys reject unknown names with a "did you mean" hint. Writing `sweeps:` instead of `sweep:` produces:

```text
Unknown top-level envelope key(s): 'sweeps' (did you mean 'sweep'?). Known keys: ['benchmark', 'multiRun', 'multi_run', 'noSweepTable', 'no_sweep_table', 'plot', 'randomSeed', 'random_seed', 'schemaVersion', 'schema_version', 'sweep', 'variables']
```

Inside the `benchmark:` body and inside sweep parameter paths, every section is set to reject unknown fields outright. A typo'd sweep parameter like `phases.profiling.concurency` (one `r`) is caught at validate time — `aiperf config validate` runs the same sweep-expansion pipeline `profile` does and surfaces the error before any compute is spent:

```text
ValidationError: 1 validation error for BenchmarkConfig
phases.0.concurrency.profiling
  Extra inputs are not permitted [type=extra_forbidden, input_value={'concurency': 8}, ...]
```

Use `aiperf config validate <file>` for routine linting. Use `aiperf config expand <file>` when you want to preview the actual variations a sweep will produce (see below). Both catch sweep-path typos; `expand` additionally renders the variation list.

## Substituting environment variables

Use `${VAR}` for required values and `${VAR:default}` for optional ones:

```yaml
benchmark:
  model: ${MODEL_NAME:meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct}
  endpoint:
    url: ${INFERENCE_URL:http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions}
    api_key: ${OPENAI_API_KEY}             # required, errors if unset
    timeout: ${TIMEOUT:600.0}
```

Run it across deployments without editing the file:

```bash
MODEL_NAME=meta-llama/Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct \
INFERENCE_URL=http://prod.example.com:8000/v1/chat/completions \
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... \
aiperf profile --config benchmark.yaml
```

Strings are auto-coerced to the right type — `TIMEOUT=600.0` becomes a float, `STREAMING=true` becomes a bool.

If a required `${VAR}` is unset, you get a clean error naming the variable, not a silent fallback.

## Reusable values and computed expressions

Define values once at the top, reference them anywhere with `{{ }}` Jinja expressions:

```yaml
variables:
  base_concurrency: 16
  isl_target: 512
  test_duration: 120

benchmark:
  dataset:
    type: synthetic
    entries: "{{ base_concurrency * 10 }}"      # 160
    prompts:
      isl:
        mean: "{{ isl_target }}"
        stddev: "{{ isl_target // 10 }}"        # 51 (integer division)
  phases:
    - name: warmup
      type: concurrency
      concurrency: "{{ base_concurrency // 2 }}"  # 8
      requests: "{{ base_concurrency * 5 }}"      # 80
      exclude_from_results: true
    - name: profiling
      type: gamma
      rate: 30
      duration: "{{ test_duration }}"
      concurrency: "{{ base_concurrency * 4 }}"   # 64
      rate_ramp: "{{ test_duration // 4 }}"       # 30
```

A few things worth knowing:

- Variables can reference other variables, in any order. AIPerf resolves the dependency graph for you.
- Typos like `{{ base_concurrancy }}` raise an error immediately — they don't silently render as an empty string.
- Numeric strings like `"42"` and `"3.14"` are coerced to `int`/`float` automatically, so you don't have to remember which fields expect numbers.
- Env vars run *before* Jinja, so you can do `entries: "{{ base * '${MULT:10}' | int }}"`.

## Multiple phases in one file

A typical benchmark is a quick warmup followed by the real measurement. CLI warmup flags are limited to scalar values per phase shape (`--warmup-request-count`, `--warmup-duration`, `--warmup-concurrency`, `--warmup-request-rate`, `--warmup-arrival-pattern`, and a handful of ramp/grace-period siblings). YAML lets you describe warmup as a full phase with all the same fields available to profiling:

```yaml
benchmark:
  phases:
    - name: warmup
      type: concurrency
      concurrency: 8
      requests: 50
      exclude_from_results: true   # don't pollute the report

    - name: profiling
      type: poisson
      rate: 30.0
      duration: 120
      concurrency: 64
      grace_period: 60             # finish in-flight requests after duration
```

Each phase is a complete arrival pattern in its own right, with its own concurrency, duration, and arrival shape (`concurrency`, `constant`, `poisson`, `gamma`, `fixed_schedule`, `user_centric`, ...).

## Adaptive scale in YAML

Adaptive scale is for single-run boundary discovery. Instead of launching a sweep or separate search trials, AIPerf runs one profiling phase, starts at a low control value, evaluates SLA windows, ramps up while the SLA passes, and then sustains near the discovered boundary.

In v1 the control variable is session/request concurrency, so adaptive scale is configured on a `concurrency` phase. The CLI exposes only the basic path: `--adaptive-scale`, `--adaptive-sustain-duration`, `--adaptive-assessment-period`, plus the existing `--concurrency` and `--benchmark-duration` flags and the adaptive-specific `--adaptive-scale-sla` flag. Advanced controller tuning lives in YAML so it stays reviewable and version-controlled.

When you combine `--config` with adaptive CLI flags, those CLI flags overlay only the basic fields on the profiling phase. If the YAML contains an advanced `adaptive_scale:` block, AIPerf preserves its strategy and tuning fields while applying the explicit CLI overrides for enablement, sustain duration, assessment period, concurrency, duration, and adaptive scale SLA.

```yaml
schemaVersion: "2.0"

benchmark:
  model: meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
  endpoint:
    url: http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions
    type: chat
    streaming: true
  dataset:
    type: synthetic
    entries: 1000
    prompts: {isl: 512, osl: 128}
  phases:
    - name: profiling
      type: concurrency
      concurrency: 200          # max control value
      duration: 3600
      adaptive_scale:
        enabled: true
        control_variable: concurrency
        min_concurrency: 1
        assessment_period: 60
        min_completed_requests: 20
        sustain_duration: 1800
        strategy:
          type: ramp_until_fail
          step_policy: sla_margin
          base_step: 10
          max_step_multiplier: 4
      sla:
        request_latency:
          p95:
            le: 30000
```

That example uses the default v1 strategy, `ramp_until_fail`, with `sla_margin` step sizing. On each assessment window, AIPerf computes the configured SLA metric and chooses a larger step when the observed value is far from the boundary, then falls back to the minimum step as it approaches the boundary.

For lower-is-better SLA filters such as latency or error rate, use `lt` or `le`:

```yaml
sla:
  request_latency:
    p95:
      le: 30000
```

For higher-is-better SLA filters such as throughput or adaptive-window goodput ratio, use `gt` or `ge`:

```yaml
sla:
  request_throughput:
    avg:
      ge: 80
  goodput_ratio:
    avg:
      ge: 0.95
```

In adaptive scale, `goodput_ratio` means successful returned requests divided by all returned requests in the assessment window. Errors and cancellations count against the denominator. This is intentionally simpler than the post-processed `goodput` metric, which is SLO-qualified and computed later from full request records.

The same `sla_margin` policy works for both directions. With multiple SLA filters, adaptive scale uses the most constrained margin so the closest boundary controls the next step.

### Future control variables

This release intentionally supports only `control_variable: concurrency`. The controller directly adjusts the profiling phase's session-concurrency limit, which is safe to raise or lower while requests are in flight.

Other control variables should be added through a small adaptive control backend when they are implemented end to end. For example, a future `users` backend would not just set an integer: it would need to resize or rebalance the user-centric schedule, including virtual-history users, spawn cadence, turn gaps, and in-flight sessions. A future `request_rate` backend would need different rate-generator semantics. Until one of those paths exists, rejecting non-`concurrency` values keeps the YAML honest and avoids implying that all load controls are interchangeable.

A likely future shape is:

```python
class AdaptiveControlBackend(Protocol):
    name: str
    current: int
    maximum: int

    def set(self, value: int) -> None: ...
```

The adaptive controller would continue to own SLA-window evaluation and step selection, while each backend owns the mechanics of changing its specific control variable.

Adaptive scale writes two timing-owned artifacts into the run directory:

```text
adaptive_scale_events.jsonl
adaptive_scale_summary.json
```

Use these to inspect controller decisions (`adaptive_window`, `adaptive_decision`, `boundary_discovered`, `sustain_started`, terminal events), the current control value, SLA value, step size, and final boundary summary.

Use adaptive scale when you want continuous pressure inside one benchmark invocation. Use `sweep` or `adaptive_search` when you want offline multi-run exploration across many independent trials.

## Sweeps in YAML

Sweeps are the killer feature of YAML configs. The CLI only ever supported list-style flags like `--concurrency 8,16,32`. YAML lets you sweep any field, combine multiple parameters, or pull from a quasi-random distribution.

Here's a 3 × 3 = 9-run grid sweep over input length and request rate:

```yaml
schemaVersion: "2.0"

sweep:
  type: grid
  parameters:
    datasets.default.prompts.isl: [128, 512, 2048]
    rate: [10.0, 30.0, 50.0]

benchmark:
  model: meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct
  endpoint:
    url: http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions
  dataset:
    type: synthetic
    entries: 500
    prompts: {isl: 512, osl: 128}      # isl is overridden by the sweep
  phases:
    - name: profiling
      type: poisson
      rate: 20.0                        # overridden by the sweep
      duration: 120
```

The `parameters:` keys are dot-paths into the `benchmark:` body. For lists, the second segment is the entry's `name`:

- `phases.profiling.rate` → the phase named `profiling`, field `rate`
- `datasets.default.prompts.isl` → the dataset named `default` (the singular `dataset:` shorthand auto-names it `default`)

The 12 most-swept phase fields also have bare-name sugar: `concurrency`, `prefill_concurrency`, `rate`, `requests`, `duration`, `sessions`, `users`, `smoothness`, `grace_period`, `concurrency_ramp`, `prefill_ramp`, `rate_ramp`. Each expands to `phases.profiling.<name>` (resolves to the unique non-warmup phase). The two forms are equivalent — see [Bare-Name Aliases](sweeps.md#bare-name-aliases-for-common-phase-fields).

Other sweep modes available in YAML:

- **`zip`** — pair parameters lockstep instead of cross-product (useful for paired ISL/OSL).
- **`scenarios`** — hand-curated named workload profiles, each a deep-merge over the base body.
- **`sobol`** / **`latin_hypercube`** — quasi-random space-filling samples.
- **`adaptive_search`** — Bayesian optimization over multiple objectives.

For a guided picker, see [Parameter Sweeps — Choosing a sweep mode](sweeps.md#choosing-a-sweep-mode).

You can preview what a sweep will run *before* spending any compute:

```bash
aiperf config expand sweep.yaml             # lists the variations
aiperf config expand sweep.yaml --full      # dumps each variation's full body
aiperf config expand sweep.yaml --index 2 --full   # inspect one variation
```

## Repeating a benchmark for confidence intervals

Running the same benchmark several times and taking the mean ± confidence interval is a separate envelope-level setting:

```yaml
multi_run:
  num_runs: 3
  cooldown_seconds: 15.0
  confidence_level: 0.95
  set_consistent_seed: true
  disable_warmup_after_first: true   # warmup once, reuse the warm cache
```

`multi_run` and `sweep` compose: a 9-variation grid × 3 runs = 27 benchmarks, with confidence intervals computed *per variation*. See [Multi-Run Confidence Reporting](multi-run-confidence.md) for what the report looks like.

## CLI helpers for working with configs

Three commands cover the common authoring tasks:

```bash
# Scaffold from a template (27+ bundled, covering most workloads)
aiperf config init --list                          # browse
aiperf config init --search sweep                  # search by keyword
aiperf config init --template goodput_slo \
  --model meta-llama/Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct \
  --url http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
  --output benchmark.yaml

# Lint a config without running it
aiperf config validate benchmark.yaml

# Preview sweep variations
aiperf config expand sweep.yaml --full
```

`validate` runs the same load pipeline `profile` does, so anything wrong shows up here — typos, missing required fields, sweep paths that don't resolve, env vars that aren't set.

## Mixing YAML with CLI flags

YAML configs and CLI flags are not either/or. Flags overlay whatever's in the file:

```bash
aiperf profile --config benchmark.yaml \
  --concurrency 32 \
  --artifact-dir ./run-2026-05-09
```

This loads `benchmark.yaml` as the base, then overrides the *profiling* phase's `concurrency` with `32` and the artifact directory with the new path. (CLI loadgen flags overlay onto the phase named `profiling` — they don't broadcast to every named phase, so multi-phase configs need YAML edits to tweak warmup or other phases.) Useful when most of your config is stable but you want to tweak one knob from a script or CI job.

The precedence order, lowest to highest:

1. Defaults baked into AIPerf
2. Values in the YAML file
3. Explicit CLI flags
